# Data Visualization Working Group Presentation

## A Review of R, Cytoscape and Python Integration for Data Visualization and Exploration

This `git` repo contains the `R` markdown document and `ipython` notebook that I used to construct a demo of reviewing `R`, `Cytoscape` and `Python` for Data Visualization and Exploration, initially presented to the Metabolomics Data Visualization Working Group on May 13, 2014, and subsequently re-used elsewhere.

## Use

To get this presentation and data, clone the git repo to a local machine.

## R, ggplot, Cytoscape

The html version of the `R`, `ggplot` and `Cytoscape` demo can be found in the repo. It can also be viewed online [here](https://rmflight.github.io/wg_vis_presentation/wg_visualization_ggplot_cytoscape_matplotlib.html).

Please note that some of the graphics currently do not show correctly in the HTML version, however when running the code locally it should work. As well, none of the `Cytoscape` graphs are shown, this will hopefully be corrected in future versions.

## Python & matplotlib

The `ipython` notebook covering `matplotlib` can be viewed [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rmflight/wg_vis_presentation/blob/master/matplotlib%20demo.ipynb).
